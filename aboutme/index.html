    <p>Hello! I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho where I currently live with my wife and our 4 dogs and 1 cat. 
        I am pursuing a degree in computer programming, but as of right now I am the general manager
    of a donut shop. I am a huge sports fanatic and am having a blast during these NBA playoffs as my
    Boston Celtics make another push for the Finals!</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life. I served as a service missionary at church
        headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, where I worked in the Church Education Department. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of my other hobbies include camping and hiking (especially with all of the dogs), reading and writing,
    and playing Dungeons and Dragons. 
  </p>
