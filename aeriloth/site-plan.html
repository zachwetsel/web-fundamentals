        Introduction:
In the beginning, the Hall of the Seven locked away their dark brother, saving the world of Aeriloth from utter destruction. The ancient Gods left the world and after thousands of years of peace and prosperity, war broke out amongst its inhabitants. The discovery and use of long lost magic had catastrophic impacts on the world, and eventually at the pinnacle of the war, the world began to change. 
No one knows what caused the swathes of land to lift into the air, creating giant sky islands above the ground. Maybe it was the Seven’s way of telling the people to stop fighting. Or maybe it had to do with the dormant Aetherite stone that lay embedded within these chunks of land. The only thing that is known is that the sky islands changed everything…

Six Things You Should Know About Aeriloth
If it exists in a typical fantasy world, it can exist in Aeriloth.
Aeriloth has a place for all of the core elements of the world’s most popular fantasy role-playing game. Throughout this site, I have included the ways that I have created and run games in this world, but feel free to make changes of your own if you would like to also use this world. While Aeriloth is a mix of a high-magic, high-society, and a low-magic, repressed society, filled with airships, monsters, demons, and endless explorable skies, heroes can still find dungeons, dragons, and other typical fantasy elements here. 
Aeriloth is a dangerous place to explore.
Adventurers in Aeriloth can venture to port islands, treetop kingdoms, dark ruins, mountain fortresses, and more. While most of the highfolk, people of the sky, live in relative calm and peace, the surface of Aeriloth, amongst the lowfolk, is quite perilous. Any voyage can go from routine to catastrophic with wind, storms, and the mysterious darkness spreading amongst the surface. When the great sky islands lifted into the air, they left behind dark chasms fraught with monsters, now free to roam the surface of the world. 
Aeriloth is an ancient and broken world.
Long ago, a war of the gods caused catastrophe. This catastrophe is why the islands now float in the sky, causing the division that is now seen in society. As the newly formed highfolk built great cities in the safety of the sky, the lowfolk on the ground were left to fend for themselves in an ever changing world. The darkness seeping from the world’s core holds mysteries and treasures of the past, that is if you can survive long enough on the surface to find them.
Aeriloth is a world caught in societal conflict.
As the highfolk prospered in safety, they seized the opportunity to conquer and rule over their brothers on the surface below. Creating Shieldhaven, the Bastion of Protection, on the surface, the lowfolk couldn’t help but take advantage of this defensive city. Taking up residence in or near the city provided a way for the highfolk to rule over the people of the surface, but things got even worse when the lowfolk discovered Aetherite on the surface, and the dormant magic that it held. 
Aeriloth is a world where magic is powerful and sought after.
Magic is commonplace and studied amongst the sky islands, but rare and unexplored by the lowfolk. When magic was first discovered on the ground, many lowfolk saw it as a way to break free of the chains of the highfolk, but their overlords weren’t keen on letting that happen. The Arcane Inquisition was formed and soon began hunting those on the surface who possessed arcane ability or discovered magical knowledge. Will magic continue to divide us, or will someone finally be able to rise up and free us from this way of life. 
Aeriloth is a world of technological wonders.
Powerful magic has long been available to the highfolk, and with its aid, ingenuity has led to the advancement of magically-infused technology. Amongst the general early marvels, such as steam power and black powder, the world of Aeriloth also has arcanocrafts like the airship, which has proven highly useful in traveling amongst the sky and the ground. While the highfolk continue to advance, most people on the surface either oppose the use of such tech, or simply reject its use in oppressing them.

      <h3>World Lore</h3>

        World Lore

Aeriloth is a land of mystery, magic, adventure, and struggle. Depending on whether you are born into the highfolk, or the surface-dwelling lowfolk, will determine a lot about how you view the world. In this section, I will outline some of the details of Aeriloth that all of the general population knows, The common knowledge of the world. I will also include typical distinctions in the knowledge based on if you were born in the skies, or reside on the ground. 

Religion
It is generally accepted that the Hall of the Seven created the world and that they still speak with and communicate with the inhabitants of their world. There is not so much a standard religion to follow in Aeriloth, but more so which of the Gods you prefer to pay tribute to. The gods have proven that they exist, so atheism is not really a belief in this world. The belief against the gods is more so that they should not be worshiped, and a small portion of the population has begun to believe this, especially amongst the lowfolk. 
	The highfolk believe that they were the blessed chosen of the gods. They were the ones that the gods deemed worthy enough to lift into the skies and protect from the darkness that they knew was coming. This has caused the highfolk to be very proud and religious people. They see themselves as holier and more blessed than the lowfolk, and are not shy about letting them hear about it.

The Creation Myth
	Everyone believes in a similar version of the creation myth: in the beginning, the gods of the Hall of the Seven fought against their evil brother and locked him away. He was sealed with the name and power of the Stormrider and has not been heard from since. The Seven then went about establishing their orders in the world and creating the life that inhabits it today.

The Hall of the Seven

Magic and Mystical Forces
	Magic was not present for a majority of Aeriloth’s life, but was eventually discovered by the inhabitants there. The use of magic during the Great War eventually led to the dormant Aetherite in the earth to lift the sky islands into the air. The people of the sky continued studying magic and learning about how to harness it using the Aetherite present on their islands. 
	The lowfolk were left without Aetherite as far as they knew. Aetherite wasn’t required for magic, but it did yield better control and power. Many sorcerers popped up here and there on the ground, but viewing them as a threat, the Arcane Inquisition was founded and soon began to hunt down magic users on the surface. This has caused the people on the surface to fear magic and be very superstitious towards magic use. 
	The lowfolk have also been afflicted with the mysterious shadows that have plagued the surface. When the sky islands lifted into the air, dark chasms with shadowy monsters were uncovered, causing the outside world to be a very dangerous place. Travel between surface towns is incredibly dangerous, though the limited use of airships that the lowfolk have has helped them to continue trading and commerce on the ground. 

Life on the Ground
	The ground leaves a harsher, more dangerous lifestyle that is perfect for adventurers. For safety, everyone lives in walled cities, the biggest of which is Shieldhaven. Very few dare to venture outside their city’s walls, but those who do usually are paid quite handsomely, that is if they can survive. Ground cities are visited monthly by the Arcane Inquisition and all magic users and magical devices are taken. Other than these visits, the highfolk do not get too involved with cities outside of Shieldhaven. 
	Shieldhaven was build by the highfolk and acts as an extension of their empire, enabling them to rule the lowfolk on the ground. Tensions currently run pretty high between the leadership of Shieldhaven and the lowfolk citizens who live there. 

Life in the Sky
	The highfolk live a life of prosperity. They use magic in every part of their lives, and even study it at the great Prixonia Academy of Arcana. The general populace of the sky islands believes that the lowfolk are all savages who want to rise up and take over their higher way of life. Most highfolk will not ever set foot on the surface of Aeriloth and do not care to hear of the struggles of the people of the surface. 
	There are a few allies hidden amongst the highfolk. Lowfolk who have either managed to infiltrate into higher society, or highfolk who have converted the the surface’s cause. Small acts of rebellion are often carried out by these people, even going as far as protecting known magic users on the surface or smuggling magical goods to the people below.

      <h3>Character Creation</h3>
      <p>
        Character Creation
Making a character that you love is a major part of Dungeons and Dragons. On this page, I will walk you through the general steps for making your own character. I have tailored options to my setting of Aeriloth, but know that there are a ton of other character creation options, just check with your dungeon master on what they allow before bringing in your own options.

Get your Character Sheet.
To start making your character, you will need a place to store all of your character information. You can download the standard 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons character sheet from Wizards of the Coast here: https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf
Whether you want to print a physical copy of this or just edit it digitally is up to you. There are also many other tools you can use to hold your character information such as DNDBeyond, several virtual tabletops such as Roll20, and many other digital apps.
Choose your character’s race.
Every character has a race, one of the many intelligent peoples of the world of Aeriloth. The most common races in this world are dwarves, elves, humans, and halflings, but there are many other races in this world (and maybe more if you are not playing in Aeriloth, but I have tailored the list here to the ones present in my world). Choose one of the races listed here and write the race name and relevant race information on your character sheet. 
Available Races:
Aarakocra - Bipedal humanoid birds with the ability to fly. 
Traits: Size - Medium, Flight, Talons, Speed - 25 ft walking or 50 ft flying

Choose your character’s class.
Every adventurer has a class describing their skills and special talents and the tactics they employ while out adventuring. Keep in mind that in the world of Aeriloth, lowfolk who possess magic are hunted and so they must keep their magic hidden. You can still choose magical characters, but this may influence who your character is. Choose from the classes below and write it on your character sheet.
Available Classes:
Barbarian - A fierce warrior who can enter into a battle rage. Main stats should be Constitution and Strength.
Bard - An inspiring magician whose power echoes the music of creation. Main stat should be Charisma.
Cleric - A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power. Main stat should be Wisdom.
Druid - A priest of the Old Faith, wielding the powers of nature and adopting animal forms. Main stat should be Wisdom.
Fighter - A master of martial combat, skilled with a variety of weapons and armor. Main stat should be Strength or Dexterity.
Monk - A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection. Main stat should be Dexterity and Wisdom.
Paladin - A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath. Main stat should be Strength and Charisma.
Ranger - A warrior who combats threats on the edges of civilization. Main stats should be Strength and Dexterity.
Rogue - A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies. Main stat should be Dexterity.
Sorcerer - A spellcaster who draws on inherent magic from a gift or bloodline. Main stat should be Charisma. 
Warlock - A wielder of magic that is derived from a bargain with an extraplanar entity. Main stat should be Charisma.
Wizard - A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality. Main stat should be Wisdom.

Determine your ability scores.
Much of what your character does in the game is determined by their six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score that you will write on your character sheet. You will also write an ability modifier next to each score that you will use to modify your dice rolls when you are playing the game. The abilities are defined as:
	Strength: Measures natural athleticism and bodily power
	Dexterity: Measures physical agility, reflexes, balance, and poise
	Constitution: Measures health, stamina, and vital force
	Intelligence: Measures mental acuity, information recall, and analytical thinking
	Wisdom: Measures awareness, intuition, and insight
	Charisma: Measures confidence, eloquence, and leadership
There are many different ways to generate your ability scores. We will be using the standard array method in my campaign, but check with your dungeon master if you are not playing with me to determine the best way for you to generate your stats. Keep in mind that the class section above recommends what you make your best stats be.
An ability score is a number between 1 and 20 that shows how good your character is with that ability. The higher the number, the better they are. The standard array we will be using are the numbers 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Determine which of these numbers you would like to occupy each of your abilities, using each number once. As a bonus, you also get to determine one ability that you will increase by an additional 2 points and another ability that you will increase by 1 point. Write your final ability score number in each of the labeled spots on your character sheet. 

Determine ability score modifiers
Your ability score modifiers are what you will use to modify your dice rolls over the course of a game. This number is determined based on your ability score that you just calculated in the last step. Use the following table to determine your ability modifier for each ability and write it in the space next to each ability score.
Score - Modifier
1 - -5
2-3 - -4
4-5 - -3
6-7 - -2
8-9 - -1
10-11 - 0
12-13 - +1
14-15 - +2
16-17 - +3
18-19 - +4
20 - +5

Describe your character
Now that you know the basic game mechanics of your character, it’s time to get creative in fleshing out the finer details of your character. Come up with a good name for your character, as well as what you want them to look like. Come up with a short history of your character’s life up to this point. What moments in their life really shaped them into the person they are now? In Aeriloth, the sky is literally the limit, so get creative in making your character unique. Reach out to me if you would like help or need more information about the world for your character.

Choose equipment
Your character’s class determines a lot of the equipment that they start with; however this is all customizable to make the character that you truly want to play. Look through the guidelines for what your class gives you and if you would like to change anything, reach out to me and we can work it all out. Write your equipment in the equipment section of your character sheet. 

You now have a fully functional character sheet to play with me in the world of Aeriloth. As you play your character, you will grow and learn new things, so you will be constantly adding and taking away things from your sheet. Good luck to you in playing and I hope you have fun!
