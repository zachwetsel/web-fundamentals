                <h4>Aeriloth is a land of mystery, magic, adventure, and struggle. Depending on whether you are born into the highfolk, or the surface-dwelling lowfolk, will determine a lot about how you view the world. In this section, I will outline some of the details of Aeriloth that all of the general population knows, The common knowledge of the world. I will also include typical distinctions in the knowledge based on if you were born in the skies, or reside on the ground.</h4>

            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <h4>It is generally accepted that the Hall of the Seven created the world and that they still speak with and communicate with the inhabitants of their world. There is not so much a standard religion to follow in Aeriloth, but more so which of the Gods you prefer to pay tribute to. The gods have proven that they exist, so atheism is not really a belief in this world. The belief against the gods is more so that they should not be worshiped, and a small portion of the population has begun to believe this, especially amongst the lowfolk. The highfolk believe that they were the blessed chosen of the gods. They were the ones that the gods deemed worthy enough to lift into the skies and protect from the darkness that they knew was coming. This has caused the highfolk to be very proud and religious people. They see themselves as holier and more blessed than the lowfolk, and are not shy about letting them hear about it.</h4>
            <h2>The Creation Myth</h2>
            <h4>Everyone believes in a similar version of the creation myth: in the beginning, the gods of the Hall of the Seven fought against their evil brother and locked him away. He was sealed with the name and power of the Stormrider and has not been heard from since. The Seven then went about establishing their orders in the world and creating the life that inhabits it today.</h4>

            <h2>Magic and Mystical Forces</h2>
            <p>Magic was not present for a majority of Aeriloth’s life, but was eventually discovered by the inhabitants there. The use of magic during the Great War eventually led to the dormant Aetherite in the earth to lift the sky islands into the air. The people of the sky continued studying magic and learning about how to harness it using the Aetherite present on their islands. The lowfolk were left without Aetherite as far as they knew. Aetherite wasn’t required for magic, but it did yield better control and power. Many sorcerers popped up here and there on the ground, but viewing them as a threat, the Arcane Inquisition was founded and soon began to hunt down magic users on the surface. This has caused the people on the surface to fear magic and be very superstitious towards magic use. The lowfolk have also been afflicted with the mysterious shadows that have plagued the surface. When the sky islands lifted into the air, dark chasms with shadowy monsters were uncovered, causing the outside world to be a very dangerous place. Travel between surface towns is incredibly dangerous, though the limited use of airships that the lowfolk have has helped them to continue trading and commerce on the ground.</p>

                <h2>Life on the Fround</h2>
                <p>The ground leaves a harsher, more dangerous lifestyle that is perfect for adventurers. For safety, everyone lives in walled cities, the biggest of which is Shieldhaven. Very few dare to venture outside their city’s walls, but those who do usually are paid quite handsomely, that is if they can survive. Ground cities are visited monthly by the Arcane Inquisition and all magic users and magical devices are taken. Other than these visits, the highfolk do not get too involved with cities outside of Shieldhaven. Shieldhaven was build by the highfolk and acts as an extension of their empire, enabling them to rule the lowfolk on the ground. Tensions currently run pretty high between the leadership of Shieldhaven and the lowfolk citizens who live there.</p>

                <h2>Life in the Sky</h2>
                <p>The highfolk live a life of prosperity. They use magic in every part of their lives, and even study it at the great Prixonia Academy of Arcana. The general populace of the sky islands believes that the lowfolk are all savages who want to rise up and take over their higher way of life. Most highfolk will not ever set foot on the surface of Aeriloth and do not care to hear of the struggles of the people of the surface. There are a few allies hidden amongst the highfolk. Lowfolk who have either managed to infiltrate into higher society, or highfolk who have converted the the surface’s cause. Small acts of rebellion are often carried out by these people, even going as far as protecting known magic users on the surface or smuggling magical goods to the people below.</p>
