                <h4>In the beginning, the Hall of the Seven locked away their dark brother, saving the world of Aeriloth from utter destruction. The ancient Gods left the world and after thousands of years of peace and prosperity, war broke out amongst its inhabitants. The discovery and use of long lost magic had catastrophic impacts on the world, and eventually at the pinnacle of the war, the world began to change. No one knows what caused the swathes of land to lift into the air, creating giant sky islands above the ground. Maybe it was the Seven’s way of telling the people to stop fighting. Or maybe it had to do with the dormant Aetherite stone that lay embedded within these chunks of land. The only thing that is known is that the sky islands changed everything…</h4>

            <h2>Six Things You Should Know About Aeriloth</h2>
            <section id="first_thing">
                <h3>If it exists in a typical fantasy world, it can exist in Aeriloth</h3>
                <p>Aeriloth has a place for all of the core elements of the world’s most popular fantasy role-playing game. Throughout this site, I have included the ways that I have created and run games in this world, but feel free to make changes of your own if you would like to also use this world. While Aeriloth is a mix of a high-magic, high-society, and a low-magic, repressed society, filled with airships, monsters, demons, and endless explorable skies, heroes can still find dungeons, dragons, and other typical fantasy elements here.</p>

            <section id="second_thing">
                <h3>Aeriloth is a dangerous place to explore</h3>
                <p>Adventurers in Aeriloth can venture to port islands, treetop kingdoms, dark ruins, mountain fortresses, and more. While most of the highfolk, people of the sky, live in relative calm and peace, the surface of Aeriloth, amongst the lowfolk, is quite perilous. Any voyage can go from routine to catastrophic with wind, storms, and the mysterious darkness spreading amongst the surface. When the great sky islands lifted into the air, they left behind dark chasms fraught with monsters, now free to roam the surface of the world.</p>

            <section id="third_thing">
                <h3>Aeriloth is an ancient and broken world</h3>
                <p>Long ago, a war of the gods caused catastrophe. This catastrophe is why the islands now float in the sky, causing the division that is now seen in society. As the newly formed highfolk built great cities in the safety of the sky, the lowfolk on the ground were left to fend for themselves in an ever changing world. The darkness seeping from the world’s core holds mysteries and treasures of the past, that is if you can survive long enough on the surface to find them. </p>

            <section id="fourth_thing">
                <h3>Aeriloth is a world caught in societal conflict</h3>
                <p>As the highfolk prospered in safety, they seized the opportunity to conquer and rule over their brothers on the surface below. Creating Shieldhaven, the Bastion of Protection, on the surface, the lowfolk couldn’t help but take advantage of this defensive city. Taking up residence in or near the city provided a way for the highfolk to rule over the people of the surface, but things got even worse when the lowfolk discovered Aetherite on the surface, and the dormant magic that it held. </p>

            <section id="fifth_thing">
                <h3>Aeriloth is a world where magic is powerful and sought after</h3>
                <p>Magic is commonplace and studied amongst the sky islands, but rare and unexplored by the lowfolk. When magic was first discovered on the ground, many lowfolk saw it as a way to break free of the chains of the highfolk, but their overlords weren’t keen on letting that happen. The Arcane Inquisition was formed and soon began hunting those on the surface who possessed arcane ability or discovered magical knowledge. Will magic continue to divide us, or will someone finally be able to rise up and free us from this way of life. </p>

            <section id="sixth_thing">
                <h3>Aeriloth is a world of technological wonders</h3>
                <p>Powerful magic has long been available to the highfolk, and with its aid, ingenuity has led to the advancement of magically-infused technology. Amongst the general early marvels, such as steam power and black powder, the world of Aeriloth also has arcanocrafts like the airship, which has proven highly useful in traveling amongst the sky and the ground. While the highfolk continue to advance, most people on the surface either oppose the use of such tech, or simply reject its use in oppressing them. </p>
