                <h2>Character Creation</h2>
                <p>Making a character that you love is a major part of Dungeons and Dragons. On this page, I will walk you through the general steps for making your own character. I have tailored options to my setting of Aeriloth, but know that there are a ton of other character creation options, just check with your dungeon master on what they allow before bringing in your own options.</p>

            <div id="character-sheet">
                <h2>Get Your Character Sheet</h2>
                <p>To start making your character, you will need a place to store all of your character information. You can download the standard 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons character sheet from Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf">here</a>. Whether you want to print a physical copy of this or just edit it digitally is up to you. There are also many other tools you can use to hold your character information such as DNDBeyond, several virtual tabletops such as Roll20, and many other digital apps.</p>

            <div id="race">
                <h2 id="race-header">Choose Your Character's Race</h2>
                <p id="race-txt">Every character has a race, one of the many intelligent peoples of the world of Aeriloth. The most common races in this world are dwarves, elves, humans, and halflings, but there are many other races in this world (and maybe more if you are not playing in Aeriloth, but I have tailored the list here to the ones present in my world). Choose one of the races listed here and write the race name and relevant race information on your character sheet.</p>

                <p>Much of what your character does in the game is determined by their six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score that you will write on your character sheet. You will also write an ability modifier next to each score that you will use to modify your dice rolls when you are playing the game. The abilities are defined as follows:</p>

                <p>There are many different ways to generate your ability scores. We will be using the standard array method in my campaign, but check with your dungeon master if you are not playing with me to determine the best way for you to generate your stats. Keep in mind that the class section above recommends what you make your best stats be. An ability score is a number between 1 and 20 that shows how good your character is with that ability. The higher the number, the better they are. The standard array we will be using are the numbers 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Determine which of these numbers you would like to occupy each of your abilities, using each number once. As a bonus, you also get to determine one ability that you will increase by an additional 2 points and another ability that you will increase by 1 point. Write your final ability score number in each of the labeled spots on your character sheet.</p>

                <h2>Determine Your Ability Score Modifiers</h2>
                <p>Your ability score modifiers are what you will use to modify your dice rolls over the course of a game. This number is determined based on your ability score that you just calculated in the last step. Use the following table to determine your ability modifier for each ability and write it in the space next to each ability score.</p>
